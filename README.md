# AHP Pairwise Comparisons
* [Go to the application](pwapp.html)

This is a very simple web app that allows you to:

1. Choose the number of items being pairwise compared
2. Choose the calculation algorithm
3. Choose to normalize/idealize the result
4. And it calculates the resulting priority vector.

Note: This application does not store anything for you.  It is meant to be a
place to input pairwise data and see the results.  If you want to do more
complex calculations, please see [Bill Adams' pyanp Python library](https://pyanp.org).
